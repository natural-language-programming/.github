  Natural Language Programming (NLP) is the practice of using human language, 
  such as English, to instruct a computer system or programming environment, 
  akin to traditional code instructing a processor. It involves writing concise, 
  natural language sentences or phrases that describe the desired program behavior, 
  simplifying the programming process and making it more accessible to non-technical 
  users. By interpreting and executing natural language statements as program 
  instructions, Natural Language Programming bridges the gap between human-readable 
  and machine-executable code.
