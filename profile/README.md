  Natural Language Programming is the practice of using human language, such as English, 
  to instruct a computer system or programming environment, akin to traditional code 
  instructing a processor. It involves writing natural language sentences or phrases that 
  describe the desired behavior, simplifying the programming process and making it more 
  accessible to humans. 
  By interpreting and executing natural language statements as instructions, Natural 
  Language Programming bridges the gap between human-readable and machine-executable code.
